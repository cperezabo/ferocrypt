# Ferocrypt

A simple script to generate Let's Encrypt certificates and upload them to your Ferozo account.

It uses 1Password as information provider.

It fails sometimes. If it does, try later (seriously). I haven't got the time to debug it

## Usage

```shell
ruby lib/ferocrypt.rb your@email "Name of the 1Password item to use"
```
